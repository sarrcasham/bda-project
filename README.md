# bda-project

This project intends to construct a machine learning model aimed at classifying vehicles into various categories based on multiple attributes such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety feature ratings. The dataset contains 1,728 examples of cars, each divided into four classes: unacceptable (unacc), acceptable (acc), good, and very good (vgood).
